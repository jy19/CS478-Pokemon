|c| Crystal RBY|okay piex brought me here
|c| Crystal RBY|what is this about
|c|★Piexplode|right so
|c|★Piexplode|I shou;ld be invulernable now
|c|★Piexplode|basically crystal_
|c|★Lutra|is that amnesia missed right?
|c|★Piexplode|there's one glitch basically
|c|★Piexplode|ye
|c|★Piexplode|dig\/fly
|c|★Piexplode|if you're para'd whilst
|c| Crystal RBY|amnesia should not miss
|c|★Piexplode|in the air\/underground
|c|★Piexplode|you are totally
|c|★Piexplode|invulnerable
|c|★Piexplode|the question is why did a
|c|★Piexplode|non-attack
|c|★Piexplode|give a is-missed message
|c|★Piexplode|and is that the correct message or not?

|c|★Piexplode|is that correct?
|c|★Piexplode|I'd only just noticed
|c|★Piexplode|that it was

|c|★Lutra|we may as well quit then
|c| Crystal RBY|so is this a new bug or what
|c|★Piexplode|yea probably
|c|★Piexplode|ye I think
|c|★Piexplode|testing one proper bug
|c|★Piexplode|that's meant to exist
|c|★Piexplode|have found
|c|★Piexplode|bugs within bugs
|c|★Piexplode|insection
|c| Crystal RBY|but this amnesia actually raise your special
|c|★Piexplode|B]
|c|★Piexplode|can you test on cart
|c| Crystal RBY|even though it stated that it missed
|c|★Piexplode|what's meant to happen
|c|★Piexplode|in this scenario?
|c| Crystal RBY|but did*
|c| Crystal RBY|amnesia vs a dig\/fly target?
|c|★Piexplode|amensia FROM the mon that used dig\/fy
|c|★Lutra|amnesia missed, so it didn't boost my special
|c|★Lutra|on here
|c| Crystal RBY|if you use dig or fly, next turn you hit with it
|c| Crystal RBY|you cant use another move
|c| Crystal RBY|until the turn after you hit
|c|★Piexplode|wait so
|c|★Piexplode|when you've used fly\/dig
|c|★Piexplode|you can't hit them
|c|★Piexplode|they can't hit you?
|c|★Piexplode|is that what's meant to happen?
|c| Crystal RBY|?
|c|★Piexplode|lutra successfully
|c|★Piexplode|became invulnerable
|c| Crystal RBY|i dont get what youre talking about lol
|c|★Piexplode|and now
|c|★Piexplode|they can't hit me
|c|★Piexplode|or
|c|★Piexplode|they can't boost with amnesia
|c|★Piexplode|WAIT NO
|c| Crystal RBY|if a pokemon becomes invulnerable due to the fly\/dig glitch
|c|★Piexplode|Lutra -> dig success
|c| Crystal RBY|he can use any move normally
|c|★Piexplode|Amnesia -> fail, Attack(Surf)->hit
|c|★Piexplode|okay
|c|★Piexplode|well then
|c|★Piexplode|we have a bug
|c|★Piexplode|as his amnesia fails
|c|★Piexplode|when he's undergound\/in the air
|c| Crystal RBY|but how can he use amnesia when undergound or when in the air???
|c| Crystal RBY|if you FP you're no longer ug\/flying, just invulnerable
|c| Crystal RBY|it's a different thing
|c|★Lutra|lol
|c|★Piexplode|that's what we don't know
|c| Crystal RBY|which turn in this battle are you referring to anyway?
|c|★Piexplode|turn 4, 5
|c|★Lutra|my Amnesia misses when I'm invulnerable, that's all
|c|★Lutra|xd
|c|★Lutra|Piexplode is trying to say
|c|★Piexplode|ye
|c|★Lutra|I think
|c|★Piexplode|that's exactly right
|c|★Lutra|so it doesn't boost
|c| Crystal RBY|yeah turn 4 amnesia should not miss
|c|★Lutra|report it, piex :p
|c| Crystal RBY|that's a PS bug
|c|★Piexplode|okies
|c|★Piexplode|B]
|-message|Piexplode forfeited.
