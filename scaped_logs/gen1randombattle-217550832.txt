|player|p1|gen 1 is gay|2
|c| gen 1 is gay|suck this
|c| gen 1 is gay|you'll never get this high
|c|★jb champ|but that happens
|c| gen 1 is gay|luck comes and goes
|c| gen 1 is gay|but you make bad plays
|c| gen 1 is gay|so you lose in the long run
|c|★jb champ|its not my fault
|player|p1|gen 1 is homo|2
|c| gen 1 is homo|your bad plays?
|c| gen 1 is homo|they're absolutely your fault
|c|★jb champ|thats why i got such a bad ranking, right?
|c| gen 1 is homo|do i though moron
|c| gen 1 is homo|check the other two accounts i just changed to
|c|★jb champ|i know
|c|★jb champ|but you are just a sore loser that is all
|c| gen 1 is homo|it must be easier when it happens to you all the time
|c| gen 1 is homo|you're used to it
|c| gen 1 is homo|see i only lose when some idiot like you gets lucky as fuck
|c|★jb champ|i got screwed many times before
|c|★jb champ|deal with it and move on
|c| gen 1 is homo|and you've no doubt screwed yourself many times before
|c| gen 1 is homo|with shit play
|c|★jb champ|if it makes you happy, keep thinking that
|c| gen 1 is homo|i'm sure of that
|c| gen 1 is homo|it's very obviously to anyone who's not an idiot
|c|★jb champ|have a good day
|c| gen 1 is homo|you played this terribly
|c|★jb champ|i won
|c| gen 1 is homo|rng decided you would win despite your horrible play
|c| gen 1 is homo|i agree
|c| gen 1 is homo|what's your point
|c| gen 1 is homo|i'm saying you're bad
|c|★jb champ|right
|c|★jb champ|if you think so
|c| gen 1 is homo|it's not a matter of opinion
|c| gen 1 is homo|it's objectively the case
|c| gen 1 is homo|your team was much, much better
|c| gen 1 is homo|then you got a ton of hax
|c|★jb champ|yeah.. that is why i win most of my matches
|c| gen 1 is homo|and i still almost won
|c|★jb champ|look at the facts pro
|c| gen 1 is homo|you win against people who are even dumber, sure
|c|★jb champ|you had a slowbro
|c|★jb champ|so your team was better
|c| gen 1 is homo|you froze my slowbro
|c| gen 1 is homo|while you were paralyzed
|c|★jb champ|granted, i got the freeze on bro
|c| gen 1 is homo|so no
|c| gen 1 is homo|the luck was 100% on your side
|c|★jb champ|but that was my only option
|c| gen 1 is homo|and i almost brought it back anyway
|c| gen 1 is homo|by outplaying you all game long
|c|★jb champ|a "good" player like yourself should know that
|c|★jb champ|so lecture me
|c| gen 1 is homo|what would you like to be lectured on
|c| gen 1 is homo|there's so much to cover
|c|★jb champ|what was i supposed to do against slowbro without any big sarifices?
|c|★jb champ|except go for the freeze
|c| gen 1 is homo|your hilarious swords dance with vileplume is a good place to start
|c| gen 1 is homo|that made absolutely 0 sense
|c|★jb champ|not the point
|c|★jb champ|just slowbro
|c| gen 1 is homo|lmfao
|c| gen 1 is homo|what was i supposed to do against slowbro without any big sarifices?
|c|★jb champ|if i had such a great team, tell me how i should have beaten slowbro
|c| gen 1 is homo|you DO sacrifice something
|c| gen 1 is homo|that's the play there
|c|★jb champ|yeah
|c| gen 1 is homo|instead of just hoping you get some minor shot at luck
|c| gen 1 is homo|sure you got it this time, but most times you wouldn't
|c| gen 1 is homo|and you would lose
|c| gen 1 is homo|all those other times
|c| gen 1 is homo|so now we've covered two horrendous decisions of yours
|c| gen 1 is homo|any other questions?
|c|★jb champ|considering your bro could not do instant damage to my poliwhirl it was a reasonable option
|c| gen 1 is homo|it was far, far from reasonable
|c|★jb champ|whatever bro
|c| gen 1 is homo|it's not about instant, try to think more than 1 turn ahead for a second
|c|★jb champ|if it makes you happy
|c| gen 1 is homo|pretend you're not an idiot
|c|★jb champ|keep thinking that
|c| gen 1 is homo|i'm not "thinking" things that are arguable
|c|★jb champ|someday i will be a successfull lawyer. what will you be?
|c|★jb champ|a pokemon king?
|c|★jb champ|lmao
|c| gen 1 is homo|lmfao
|c| gen 1 is homo|why would you imagine that i'm not successful in real life
|c| gen 1 is homo|i'm clearly smarter than you
|c|★jb champ|because you seem to take that game way too seriously
|c|★jb champ|you are smart alright...
|c|★jb champ|i feel sorry for you bro
|c|★jb champ|having like 5 alts on the same ladder?
|c| gen 1 is homo|lol ok nice cliche shit
|c| gen 1 is homo|"i'm beaten in an argument so i'm going to pretend i'm sorry for you"
|c| gen 1 is homo|come up with something original
|c|★jb champ|if you were so good, you would keep one account because you would not have to fear losing any battles
|c| gen 1 is homo|so far
|c| gen 1 is homo|you've exhibited
|c| gen 1 is homo|0 analytical skills
|c| gen 1 is homo|and 0 creativity
|c| gen 1 is homo|are you good at anything\/
|c| gen 1 is homo|i doubt it
|c|★jb champ|alright
|c|★jb champ|so doubt it
|c| gen 1 is homo|and the point of the 5 accounts isn't fear of losing you clown
|c|★jb champ|i do not need your approval, mate
|c|★jb champ|lmfao
|c|★jb champ|so why not just use one?
|c| gen 1 is homo|i have this many accounts because it's super easy to take the top spots on this ladder (because it's all just people like you)
|c|★jb champ|alright
|c| gen 1 is homo|and it'll be funny to have all the top spots be saying gen 1 is homosexual
|c| gen 1 is homo|that's why
|c|★jb champ|so you could just have one account and have linke 2 hundred point more than anyone else if you are that good
|c| gen 1 is homo|ah math is one more thing you're bad at i see
|c| gen 1 is homo|no surprise there
|c| gen 1 is homo|once you get an account really high, it gains very little from wins and loses a ton from losses
|c| gen 1 is homo|so it only takes one battle full of luck for the other guy (like this) to set you back a ton
|c|★jb champ|bottomline is, you got unlucky this time, you lost, deal with it, it will be the other way around next time
|c| gen 1 is homo|the bottomline, that started this whole thing
|c| gen 1 is homo|is you're bad
|c| gen 1 is homo|and i wanted you to know that
|c| gen 1 is homo|it took an insane amount of luck for you to win
|c|★jb champ|i know that i am not
|c| gen 1 is homo|and if you got just a little less
|c| gen 1 is homo|i would've won
|c|★jb champ|yeah, against a way better team...
|c| gen 1 is homo|yes, you did have a way better team
|c| gen 1 is homo|no doubt
|c|★jb champ|alright pal
|c| gen 1 is homo|if you don't think so, you just don't know this tier very well
|c|★jb champ|whatever floats you baot
|c|★jb champ|*boat
|c| gen 1 is homo|3\/6 of mine
|c| gen 1 is homo|were about useless
|c| gen 1 is homo|all of yours are fairly good
|c| gen 1 is homo|your team is MUCH better
|c|★jb champ|i see...
|c|★jb champ|alright pal
|c|★jb champ|see you later, mate
|c| gen 1 is homo|glad i could take the time to chip away at your retardation
|c| gen 1 is homo|later
|c|★jb champ|have a nice day and good luck next time
